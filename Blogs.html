     <b> <h1 style="padding-left: 100px; color: orangered; border: 2px solid yellow;">What is Java?</h1></b>
      <p style="color: coral; font-size: 20px;">A well-liked and frequently used high-level programming language is Java. <br> Since its initial release by Sun Microsystems in 1995 <br>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages.

        Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming language since then.[18] Java was the third most popular programming language in 2022 according to GitHub[19] and it is ranked fourth on TIOBE index as of October 2023.[20] Although still widely popular, there has been a gradual decline in use of Java in recent years with other languages using JVM gaining popularity.[21]
        
        Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.
        
        As of September 2023, Java 21 is the latest version, which is also a long-term support (LTS) version. Java 8, 11, and 17 are previous LTS versions still officially supported.</p>
 

    <h1 style="padding-left: 100px; color: orangered; border: 2px solid yellow;" >What is a Full Stack Developer?</h1>
    <p style="color: coral; font-size: 20px;">A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming <br> is known as a full-stack developer. They have experience dealing with a variety <br>In computing, a solution stack or software stack is a set of software subsystems or components needed to create a complete platform such that no additional software is needed to support applications.[1] Applications are said to "run on" or "run on top of" the resulting platform.

      For example, to develop a web application, the architect defines the stack as the target operating system, web server, database, and programming language. Another version of a software stack is operating system, middleware, database, and applications.[2] Regularly, the components of a software stack are developed by different developers independently from one another.
      
      Some components/subsystems of an overall system are chosen together often enough that the particular set is referred to by a name representing the whole, rather than by naming the parts. Typically, the name is an acronym representing the individual components.[3]
      
      The term "solution stack" has, historically, occasionally included hardware components as part of a final product, mixing both the hardware and software in layers of support.[4][5]
      
      A full-stack developer is expected to be able to work in all the layers of the application (front-end and back-end). A full-stack developer can be defined as a developer or an engineer who works with both the front and back end development of a website, web application or desktop application.[6] This means they can lead platform builds that involve databases, user-facing websites, and working with clients during the planning phase of projects.</p>

            Features of Java Explained</h1>
            <p  style="color: coral; font-size: 20px;">The popular programming language Java has been around for more than 20 years. <br> Its popularity can be attributed to, among other things, its portability and security.</p>
            <p style="color: coral; font-size: 20px;">1. Simple <br>
              Java is a simple programming language and easy to understand because it does not contain complexities that exist in prior programming languages. In fact, simplicity was the design aim of Javasoft people, because it has to work on electronic devices where less memory/resources are available. Java contains the same syntax as C, and C++, so the programmers who are switching to Java will not face any problems in terms of syntax. Secondly, the concept of pointers has been completely removed from Java which leads to confusion for a programmer and pointers are also vulnerable to security.</p>

              <p style="color: coral; font-size: 20px;">2. Object-Oriented <br>

                Java is an Object Oriented Programming Language, which means in Java everything is written in terms of classes and objects. Now, what is an Object? The object is nothing but a real-world entity that can represent any person, place, or thing and can be distinguished from others. Every object near us has some state and behaviour associated with it.
                
                For example, my mobile phone is a real-world entity and has states like colour, model, brand, camera quality, etc, and these properties are represented by variables. Also mobile is associated with actions like, calling, messaging, photography, etc and these actions are represented by methods in Java. 
                
                Now, we saw what an object is and also learned about the state and behaviour associated with the object.
                
                What is Class? A collection of objects that exhibits the same state and behavior will come under the same group called class. For example, Samsung, Apple, Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, etc are different brands making various models of smartphones, but they all come under the same group known as Mobile Phones.
                
                The main concepts of any Object Oriented Programming language are given below: 
                
                Class and Object
                Encapsulation
                Abstraction   
                Inheritance
                Polymorphism</p>
                <p style="color: coral; font-size: 20px;">3. Platform Independent <br>
                  The design objective of javasoft people is to develop a language that must work on any platform. Here platform means a type of operating system and hardware technology. Java allows programmers to write their program on any machine with any configuration and to execute it on any other machine having different configurations. 
                  
                  In Java, Java source code is compiled to bytecode and this bytecode is not bound to any platform. In fact, this bytecode is only understandable by the Java Virtual Machine which is installed in our system. What I meant to say is that every operating system has its own version of JVM, which is capable of reading and converting bytecode to an equivalent machine’s native language. This reduces the overhead of programmers writing system-specific code. Now programmers write programs only once, compile them, generate the bytecode and then export it anywhere. </p>
                  <p style="color: coral; font-size: 20px;">4. Portable <br>
                    The WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) concept and platform-independent feature make Java portable. Now using the Java programming language, developers can yield the same result on any machine, by writing code only once. The reason behind this is JVM and bytecode. Suppose you wrote any code in Java, then that code is first converted to equivalent bytecode which is only readable by JVM. We have different versions of JVM for different platforms. Windows machines have their own version of JVM, Linux has its own and macOS has its own version of JVM. So if you distribute your bytecode to any machine, the JVM of that machine would translate the bytecode into the respective machine code. In this way portability lets the programmers focus on development and productivity rather than writing different code for different platforms. </p>
